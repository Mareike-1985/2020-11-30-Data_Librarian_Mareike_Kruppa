Connected cameras, TV, media players, access control systems, and wireless sensors are becoming pervasive. Their applications include Retail Solutions, Home, Transportation and Automotive, Industrial and Energy etc. This growth also represents security threat, as several hacker attacks been launched using these devices as agents. We explore the current environment and propose a quantitative and qualitative trust model, using a multi dimensional exploration space, based on the hardware and software stack. This can be extended to any combination of IoT devices, and dynamically updated as the type of applications, deployment environment or any ingredients change.

IDS operate either on host or network level via utilizing anomaly detection or misuse detection. Main problem is to correctly detect intruder attack against computer network. The key point of successful detection of intrusion is choice of proper features. To resolve the problems of IDS scheme this research work propose ‚Äúan improved method to detect intrusion using machine learning algorithms‚Äù. In our paper we use KDDCUP 99 dataset to analyze efficiency of intrusion detection with different machine learning algorithms like Bayes, NaiveBayes, J48, J48Graft and Random forest. To identify network based IDS with KDDCUP 99 dataset, experimental results shows that the three algorithms J48, J48Graft and Random forest gives much better results than other machine learning algorithms. We use WEKA to check the accuracy of classified dataset via our proposed method. We have considered all the parameter for computation of result i.e. precision, recall, F ‚Äì measure and ROC.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>99, IDS, KDDCUP, Machine, Network, Precision, Recall, Security, WEKA, learning</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>DBLP:conf/secrypt/BrennerPS12</b:Tag><b:Title>Practical Applications of Homomorphic Encryption</b:Title><b:Year>2012</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Brenner</b:Last><b:First>Michael</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Perl</b:Last><b:First>Henning</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>5-14</b:Pages><b:BookTitle>SECRYPT</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>SECRYPT</b:ConferenceName><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>crypto, myown, security, usablesecurity</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords><b:BIBTEX_CrossRef>DBLP:conf/data/Holzinger12</b:BIBTEX_CrossRef></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>TUD-CS-2015-0005</b:Tag><b:Title>Market-driven Code Provisioning to Mobile Secure Hardware</b:Title><b:Year>2015</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrienko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Heuser</b:Last><b:First>Stephan</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Nguyen</b:Last><b:Middle>Duc</b:Middle><b:First>Thien</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>da Silva Ramos</b:Last><b:First>Marcos</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Rein</b:Last><b:First>Andre</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Sadeghi</b:Last><b:First>Ahmad-Reza</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference (FC)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference (FC)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>January</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Java, International-Conference-Workshop-Papers-Book-Chapters, Security, Architecture, Hardware, Secure, sss-group, from:sssgroup, Mobile, Platforms, Cards</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Review on Intrusion Detection in MANETs&#13;

A lot of the money is controlled by autonomous programs, so called smart contracts. They are executed on the platform and everyone can call their functions; vulnerabilities are therefore easily exploited. The immutable nature of the blockchain sharpens the problem even further by prohibiting belated bug fixes. In fact, there were several cases where attackers were able to steal cryptocurrency worth several millions of US Dollar [3]. This emphasises the need of soundly testing a smart contract before deployment. Unfortunately, existing security analysing tools each cover a different subsets of vulnerabilities [4]. Moreover, even when they test for the same security issues, they often find different results. A solid test run should therefore contain several tools, which makes the whole procedure very laborious. For these reasons, we provide a testbed which runs on a virtual machine (VM) with several smart contract security analysing tools integrated. It does not only offer a command line- but also an intuitive web interface. Both interfaces allow the user to analyse his contract with all the underlying tools in a single step. Additionally, our testbed provides a detailed report for each of the tools‚Äô test runs as well as an overview of the overall security issues the different tools found. Our evaluation shows that our testbed identifies significantly more potential security issues than each of the compared smart contract analysing tools individually does. Indeed, we found 92% of our analysed contracts as potentially being vulnerable, while even the most sensitive tool only flagged 76% of its successfully analysed contracts. Furthermore, we observed that occasionally, two tools testing for the same vulnerability, contradict themselves in more than 81% of the contracts successfully analysed by both tools</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>secure, security, smart-contracts, sss-group, thesis_supervised_by_SSS_member</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Analytical Study on Network Security Breach‚Äôs&#13;

The capabilities of these convenient mini-computers seem nearly boundless: They feature compelling computing power and storage resources, new interfaces such as Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),connectivity to cloud services, as well as a vast number and variety of apps. By installing these apps, users can turn a mobile device into a music player, a gaming console,a navigation system, a business assistant, and more. In addition, the current trend of increased screen sizes make these devices reasonable replacements for traditional (mobile)computing platforms such as laptops.On the other hand, mobile platforms process and store the extensive amount of sensitive information about their users, ranging from the user ‚Äôs location data to credentials for online banking and enterprise Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This raises many security and privacy concerns and makes mobile platforms attractive targets for attackers. The rapid increase in number, variety and sophistication of attacks demonstrate that the protection mechanisms offered by mobile systems today are insufficient and improvements are necessary in order to make mobile devices capable of withstanding modern security and privacy threats.This dissertation focuses on various aspects of security and privacy of mobile platforms.In particular, it consists of three parts: (i) advanced attacks on mobile platforms and countermeasures; (ii) online authentication security for mobile systems, and (iii) secure mobile applications and services.Specifically, the first part of the dissertation concentrates on advanced attacks on mobile platforms, such as code re-use attacks that hijack execution flow of benign apps without injecting malicious code, and application-level privilege escalation attacks that allow malicious or compromised apps to gain more privileges than were initially granted. In this context, we develop new advanced code re-use attack techniques that can bypass deployed protection mechanisms (e.g., Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)) and cannot be detected by any of the existing security tools (e.g., return address checkers). Further, we investigate the problem of application-level privilege escalation attacks on mobile platforms like Android, study and classify them, develop proof of concept exploits and propose countermeasures against these attacks. Our countermeasures can mitigate all types of application-level privilege escalation attacks, in contrast to alternative solutions proposed in literature.In the second part of the dissertation we investigate online authentication schemes frequently utilized by mobile users, such as the most common web authentication based upon the user‚Äôs passwords and the recently widespread mobile2-factor authentication(2FA) which extends the password-based approach with a secondary authenticator sent toa user ‚Äôs mobile device or generated on it (e.g, a One-time Password (OTP) or Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)). In this context we demonstrate various weaknesses ofmobile2FAschemes deployed for login verification by global Internet service providers(such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter, and Facebook) and by a popular Google Authenticator app. These weaknesses allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users even if their mobile device with the secondary authenticator is not compromised. We then go one step further and develop a general attack method for bypassing mobile2FAschemes.Our method relies on a cross-platform infection (mobile-to-PC or PC-to-mobile) as a first step in order to compromise the Personal Computer (PC) and a mobile device of the same user. We develop proof-of-concept prototypes for a cross-platform infection and show how an attacker can bypass various instantiations of mobile2FAschemes once both devices,PC and the mobile platform, are infected. We then deliver proof-of-concept attack implementations that bypass online banking solutions based on SMS-based TAN sand visual cryptograms, as well as login verification schemes deployed by various Internet service providers. Finally, we propose a wallet-based secure solution for password-based authentication which requires no secondary authenticator, and yet provides better security guaranties than, e.g., mobile2FAschemes.The third part of the dissertation concerns design and development of security sensitive mobile applications and services. In particular, our first application allows mobile users to replace usual keys (for doors, cars, garages, etc.) with their mobile devices. It uses electronic access tokens which are generated by the central key server and then downloaded into mobile devices for user authentication. Our solution protects access tokens in transit (e.g., while they are downloaded on the mobile device) and when they are stored and processed on the mobile platform. The unique feature of our solution is offline delegation: Users can delegate (a portion of) their access rights to other users without accessing the key server. Further, our solution is efficient even when used with constraint communication interfaces like NFC.The second application we developed is devoted to resource sharing among mobile users in ad-hoc mobile networks. It enables users to, e.g., exchange files and text messages,or share their tethering connection. Our solution addresses security threats specific toresource sharing and features the required security mechanisms (e.g., access control of resources, pseudonymity for users, and accountability for resource use). One of the key features of our solution is a privacy-preserving access control of resources based on FoF Finder (FoFF) service, which provides a user-friendly means to configure access control based upon information from social networks (e.g., friendship information) while preserving user privacy (e.g., not revealing their social network identifiers).The results presented in this dissertation were included in several peer-reviewed publications [71,91,58,107,109,61,110,65,64,30] and extended technical reports [95,57,108,31]1. Some of these publications had significant impact on follow up research.For example, our publications on new forms of code re-use attacks [71,91] motivated researchers to develop more advanced forms of ASLR(e.g., [232,156,293,157]) and tore-consider the idea of using Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) (e.g., [51,300,303,182,233,77]). Further, our work on application-level privilege escalation attacks [94,57,59] was followed by many other publications addressing this problem (e.g., [106,122,209,155,146,69,63,302]). Moreover, our access control solution using mobile devices as access tokens[110,65] demonstrated significant practical impact: in2013it was chosen as a highlight of CeBIT ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest international computer expo, and was then deployed by a large enterprise to be used by tens of thousands of company employees and millions of customers.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Theses, myown, privacy, security, sss-group</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Comparative Study of Security Issue and Challenges in IoT&#13;

Regardless of the benefits that it has brought with it to the society, IoT could compromise the security and privacy of individuals and companies at various levels. Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks, among others, are the most common attack types that face the IoT networks. To counter such attacks, companies should implement an efficient classification/detection model, which is not an easy task. This paper proposes a classification model to examine the effectiveness of several machine-learning algorithms, namely, Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Na√Øve Bayes. The machine learning algorithms are used to detect attacks on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark dataset. The UNSW-NB15 contains normal network traffic and malicious traffic instants. The experimental results reveal that RF and KNN classifiers give the best performance with an accuracy of 100% (without noise injection) and 99% (with 10% noise filtering), while the Na√Øve Bayes classifier gives the worst performance with an accuracy of 95.35% and 82.77 without noise and with 10% noise, respectively. Other evaluation matrices, such as precision and recall, also show the effectiveness of RF and KNN classifiers over Na√Øve Bayes.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Bayes, Classification, Forest, Internet, Machine, Na√Øve, Neighbors, Random, Security, Things, k-Nearest, learning, model, of</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>conf/soups/NaiakshinaDT018</b:Tag><b:Title>Deception Task Design in Developer Password Studies: Exploring a Student Sample.</b:Title><b:Year>2018</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Naiakshina</b:Last><b:First>Alena</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Danilova</b:Last><b:First>Anastasia</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Tiefenau</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>297-313</b:Pages><b:Publisher>USENIX Association</b:Publisher><b:BookTitle>SOUPS @ USENIX Security Symposium</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>SOUPS @ USENIX Security Symposium</b:ConferenceName><b:URL>http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/soups/soups2018.html#NaiakshinaDT018</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>developer, myown, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords><b:BIBTEX_CrossRef>conf/soups/2018</b:BIBTEX_CrossRef></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfDmKo2020-MASCOTS-GroupEncryption</b:Tag><b:Title>Evaluating the Performance of a State-of-the-Art Group-oriented Encryption Scheme for Dynamic Groups in an IoT Scenario</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Comments>Acceptance Rate: 27\%</b:Comments><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Ten</b:Last><b:First>Peter</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrenko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>November</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>MASCOTS '20</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>New emerging technologies, such as autonomous driving, intelligent buildings, and smart cities, are promising to revolutionize user experience and offer new services.

Along with the rise of the IoT, multiple unprecedented forms of security issues and attacks have emerged. While their limited resources disallow the utilization of computing-intensive security measures, the services of IoT devices represent an attractive target for vulnerability exploitation. Certification Authorities (CAs) have responded to the trend and offer security assessments and certification for IoT devices. To ensure qualitative and fair certification, security testing requires well-defined strategies. This bachelor thesis analyzes the existing IoT security assessment models and proposes a novel, CA oriented Testing Guide Model (TGM) for standardized and reproducible assessments. The TGM describes a complete security assessment approach for application in IoT device security certification procedures of CAs. As part of the bachelor thesis, the TGM is specified, implemented, and its applicability evaluated with the help of existing IoT devices.&#13;
&#13;
CAs account for the security of certified products. The certification of devices that (subsequently) prove to be insecure can lead to a consumer's loss of trust in the CA. Therefore, the decision for issuing certificates must be comprehensible and made carefully. For the risk estimation of security issues and vulnerabilities, it is common to make use of numerical scoring systems. Well-defined scoring systems allow precise and reproducible estimations. In addition to the introduction of the TGM, this bachelor thesis analyzes the scoring systems established in the field of IT security in regard to their applicability for the scoring of IoT related vulnerabilities, complete IoT devices, and for the specific requirements of CAs. This thesis uncovers incompatibilities and insufficiencies in the existing systems that disallow application for the scoring of IoT devices and for application by CAs. To counter these issues, the thesis introduces a novel Security Scoring System (SSS) for rating IoT devices based on the risks of their vulnerabilities, services, and operational contexts. The SSS is integrated into the TGM, implemented in software, and evaluated with a comparison to the existing scoring systems.&#13;
&#13;
To summarize, the contributions of this bachelor thesis are two novel models for the security assessment of devices of the IoT: the TGM and the SSS. The models are intended to find application for CAs and both standardize and improve the security testing and assessment procedures.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Assessment, CVSS, Certification, Evaluation, IoT, Risk, Scoring, Security, System, myown</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>conf/sp/KrombholzBP0Z19</b:Tag><b:Title>"If HTTPS Were Secure, I Wouldn't Need 2FA" - End User and Administrator Mental Models of HTTPS.</b:Title><b:Year>2019</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Krombholz</b:Last><b:First>Katharina</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Busse</b:Last><b:First>Karoline</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Pfeffer</b:Last><b:First>Katharina</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>von Zezschwitz</b:Last><b:First>Emanuel</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>246-263</b:Pages><b:StandardNumber> ISBN: 978-1-5386-6660-9</b:StandardNumber><b:Publisher>IEEE</b:Publisher><b:BookTitle>IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy</b:ConferenceName><b:URL>http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sp/sp2019.html#KrombholzBP0Z19</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, privacy, security, usablesecurity</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords><b:BIBTEX_CrossRef>conf/sp/2019</b:BIBTEX_CrossRef></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>Amo_2021</b:Tag><b:Title>Educational Warehouse: Modular, Private and Secure Cloudable Architecture System for Educational Data Storage, Analysis and Access</b:Title><b:Year>2021</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Amo</b:Last><b:First>Daniel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>G{\'{o}}mez</b:Last><b:First>Pablo</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Hern{\'{a}}ndez-Ib{\'{a}}{\~{n}}ez</b:Last><b:First>Luis</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Fonseca</b:Last><b:First>David</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>806</b:Pages><b:Volume>11</b:Volume><b:StandardNumber> DOI: 10.3390/app11020806</b:StandardNumber><b:Publisher>{MDPI} {AG}</b:Publisher><b:JournalName>Applied Sciences</b:JournalName><b:Issue>2</b:Issue><b:Month>January</b:Month><b:URL>https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fapp11020806</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>API, academicanalytics, cloud, data, datastorage, educationaldatamining, identification, learninganalytics, modularity, opendata, privacy, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>Report</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>mastersthesis</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>benyahya2018ba</b:Tag><b:Title>{An Evaluation and Benchmarking Solution for Security Information and Event Management Systemes}</b:Title><b:Year>2018</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Ben Yahya</b:Last><b:Middle>Eddine</b:Middle><b:First>Ala</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:City>Am Hubland, Informatikgeb{\"a}ude, 97074 W{\"u}rzburg, Germany</b:City><b:Department>University of W{\"u}rzburg</b:Department><b:ThesisType>Bachelor Thesis</b:ThesisType><b:Month>March</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Metrics_and_benchmarking_methodologies, Networking, Security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>cryptoeprint:2020:1119</b:Tag><b:Title>All the Numbers are US: Large-scale Abuse of Contact Discovery in Mobile Messengers</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Hagen</b:Last><b:First>Christoph</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Weinert</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Sendner</b:Last><b:First>Christoph</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrienko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Schneider</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:JournalName>Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2020/1119</b:JournalName><b:Month>September</b:Month><b:URL>https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1119</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, security, sss-group, technical-reports</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Security Issues on SAAS Model of Cloud Computing&#13;

A lot of the money is controlled by autonomous programs, so called smart contracts. They are executed on the platform and everyone can call their functions; vulnerabilities are therefore easily exploited. The immutable nature of the blockchain sharpens the problem even further by prohibiting belated bug fixes. In fact, there were several cases where attackers were able to steal cryptocurrency worth several millions of US Dollar [3]. This emphasises the need of soundly testing a smart contract before deployment. Unfortunately, existing security analysing tools each cover a different subsets of vulnerabilities [4]. Moreover, even when they test for the same security issues, they often find different results. A solid test run should therefore contain several tools, which makes the whole procedure very laborious. For these reasons, we provide a testbed which runs on a virtual machine (VM) with several smart contract security analysing tools integrated. It does not only offer a command line- but also an intuitive web interface. Both interfaces allow the user to analyse his contract with all the underlying tools in a single step. Additionally, our testbed provides a detailed report for each of the tools‚Äô test runs as well as an overview of the overall security issues the different tools found. Our evaluation shows that our testbed identifies significantly more potential security issues than each of the compared smart contract analysing tools individually does. Indeed, we found 92% of our analysed contracts as potentially being vulnerable, while even the most sensitive tool only flagged 76% of its successfully analysed contracts. Furthermore, we observed that occasionally, two tools testing for the same vulnerability, contradict themselves in more than 81% of the contracts successfully analysed by both tools</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>secure, security, smart-contracts, sss-group, thesis_supervised_by_SSS_member</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Technology Post COVID19 A Review&#13;

Internet Protocol suit is used to provide separation and Authentication services at the IP layer by authenticating and encrypting method. It is a collective of authentication between nodes at the starting session and transaction of cryptographic keys to be used during the session. Internet Protocol address is also known as IP address and IP suit. Internet Protocol Security IP sec functionality is based on two main techniques i.e. Protocol to exchange security parameters IKE and IP header extensions to carry the cryptographic information. AH ESP . IKE protocol aims for end points to exchange security parameters or proposals each of the service that is Authentication Header AH or Encapsulation Header ESP and the type of operation mode Tunnel mode or Transport mode. Now we are discuss two types of security protocols defined by IP sec i.e. Authentication Header AH and Encapsulating Security Payload ESP . Encapsulating Security Payload ESP protocol is to contribute confidentiality by specifying how to encrypt the data that is to be sent and Authentication Header AH service provides integrity protection, authentication of origin and anti replay attacks and does not offer encryption services to the payload portion of the packet. It also provides service of data integrity and origin authentication. Now we are discuss briefly implementation of AH and ESP in IP Suit. Er.

But, the growing acceptance of XML technologies for documents it is logical that security should be integrated with XML solutions. In a web application, an improper user inputs is a main cause for a wide variety of attacks. XML Path or XPath language is used for querying information from the nodes of an XML document. XPath Injection is an attack technique, much like SQL injection, exists when a malicious user can insert arbitrary XPath code into form fields and URL query parameters in order to inject this code directly into the XPath query evaluation engine. Through the crafted input a malicious user would bypass authentication or to&#13;

The study relied on data from extant literature to posit that sustainable development is attainable only when peace and security of the nation is assured. The study argued that tenable and sustainable development is possible. This assertion is evident in sustained growth and development of most developed and emerging economies of the world. Examples are the developed and emerging economies of America, Europe and Asia. In Nigeria, the near absence of relative peace and the consequent threat to security of lives and properties have affected every aspect of growth and development in the country. This situation has flourished in the light of the dynamics of political instability and its concomitant outcomes. The threat to peace and security of the nation have taken several dimensions of urban violence including ethno religious violence, electoral violence, youth militancy, and civil unrest, Boko Haram, farmers herders crisis, banditry, kidnapping etc. thus, undermining the attainment of significant achievement of the Millennium Development Goals MDGs in Nigeria. A situation that leaves great negative consequences for the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs . The study concludes that the Federal Government should seriously address all security challenges in the nation. Both carrot and stick are required in addressing the various issues that threaten peace and security in the nation. Where force is seen as the best option to address a particular issue, force should be applied. However, where negotiation and ceding of necessary grounds is adjudged the best option, they should be applied.

Not only is the IoT related to computers, people or cell phones but also to various sensors, actuators, vehicles, and other modern appliances. There are around 14 billion interconnected digital devices across the globe i.e. almost 2 devices per human being on earth. The IoT serves as a medium to connect non living things to the internet to transfer information from one point to another in their community network which automates processes and ultimately makes the life of human beings convenient. The subsequent result of amalgamating internet connectivity with powerful data analysis is a complete change in the way we humans work and live. The most vital characteristics of IoT include connectivity, active engagement, sensors, artificial intelligence, and small device use. All of this creates many challenges that need to be solved to keep this technology to continue expanding. In this paper, we have identified various applications of IoT based on recent technological and business trends and highlighted the existing challenges faced by IoT which need to be addressed considering the exponential acceptance of the concept globally and the way those challenges had been addressed in the past. We have also made a few comments on the way such challenges are being attempted to be resolved now. This paper presents the current status Internet of Things IoT in terms of technical details, and applications. Also, this paper opens a window for future work on the historical approach to study and address IoT challenges.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) provides an effective IPv6-based LLN routing protocol, namely the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Network (RPL). RPL provides adequate protection against external security attacks but stays vulnerable to internal routing attacks such as a rank attack. Malicious RPL nodes can carry out a rank attack in different forms and cause serious network performance degradation. An experimental study of the impact of the decreased rank attack on the overall network performance is presented in this paper. In also besides, it is important to understand the main influencing factors in this context. In this study, several some many network scenarios were considered with varying network sizes, attacker properties, and topological setups. The experimental results indicate a noticeable adverse effect of the rank attack on the average PDR, delay, ETX, and beacon interval. However, such impact was varied according to network size, attacker position, attacker neighbor count, number of attack-affected nodes, and overall hops increase. The results give a practical reference to the overall performance of RPL networks under rank attacks.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Attack, Internet, Protocols, RPL, Routing, Security, Things, of</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>conf/ccs/NaiakshinaDTHD017</b:Tag><b:Title>Why Do Developers Get Password Storage Wrong?: A Qualitative Usability Study.</b:Title><b:Year>2017</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Naiakshina</b:Last><b:First>Alena</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Danilova</b:Last><b:First>Anastasia</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Tiefenau</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Herzog</b:Last><b:First>Marco</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dechand</b:Last><b:First>Sergej</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>311-328</b:Pages><b:StandardNumber> ISBN: 978-1-4503-4946-8</b:StandardNumber><b:Publisher>ACM</b:Publisher><b:BookTitle>CCS</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>CCS</b:ConferenceName><b:URL>http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ccs/ccs2017.html#NaiakshinaDTHD017</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>developer, myown, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords><b:BIBTEX_CrossRef>conf/ccs/2017</b:BIBTEX_CrossRef></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Integrated ERP and E Commerce for Medicines&#13;

This has a huge impact on the protection, identification and authentication of three-dimensional medical volume data. In response to these problems, a new difference perceptual hashing algorithm for medical volume data is proposed in this paper. It uses the difference between adjacent elements in each column of the volume data feature matrix to generate a hashing sequence. Experiments show that it has a good ability to resist local nonlinear geometric attacks.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>cover, cryptography, image, security, steganography</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>conf/chi/NaiakshinaDGZ019</b:Tag><b:Title>"If you want, I can store the encrypted password": A Password-Storage Field Study with Freelance Developers.</b:Title><b:Year>2019</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Naiakshina</b:Last><b:First>Alena</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Danilova</b:Last><b:First>Anastasia</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Gerlitz</b:Last><b:First>Eva</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>von Zezschwitz</b:Last><b:First>Emanuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author><b:Editor><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Brewster</b:Last><b:Middle>A.</b:Middle><b:First>Stephen</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Fitzpatrick</b:Last><b:First>Geraldine</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Cox</b:Last><b:Middle>L.</b:Middle><b:First>Anna</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kostakos</b:Last><b:First>Vassilis</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Editor></b:Author><b:Pages>140</b:Pages><b:StandardNumber> ISBN: 978-1-4503-5970-2</b:StandardNumber><b:Publisher>ACM</b:Publisher><b:BookTitle>CHI</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>CHI</b:ConferenceName><b:URL>http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/chi2019.html#NaiakshinaDGZ019</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>developer, myown, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords><b:BIBTEX_CrossRef>conf/chi/2019</b:BIBTEX_CrossRef></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfDmKo2020-MASCOTS-GroupEncryption</b:Tag><b:Title>Evaluating the Performance of a State-of-the-Art Group-oriented Encryption Scheme for Dynamic Groups in an IoT Scenario</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Comments>Acceptance Rate: 27\%</b:Comments><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Ten</b:Last><b:First>Peter</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrenko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>November</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>MASCOTS '20</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>New emerging technologies, such as autonomous driving, intelligent buildings, and smart cities, are promising to revolutionize user experience and offer new services. The world has to undergo large scale deployment of billions of things ‚Äî cost-efficient intelligent sensors that will be interconnected into extensive networks and will collect and supply data to intelligent algorithms ‚Äî to make it happen. To date, however, it is challenging to secure such an infrastructure for many-fold reasons, such as resource constraints of things, large scale deployment, manyto-many communication patterns, and dynamically changing communication groups. All these factors rule out most of the state-of-the-art encryption and key-management techniques. Group encryption algorithms are well-suitable for many-tomany communication patterns typical for IoT networks, and many of them can deal with dynamic groups. There are, however, very few constructions that could potentially fulfill the computational and storage constraints of IoT devices while providing sufficient scalability for large networks. The promising candidates, such as construction by Nishat et al. [1], were not evaluated using IoT platforms and under constraints typical for IoT networks. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present the evaluation of a state-of-the-art group-oriented encryption scheme by Nishat et al. to identify its applicability to IoT systems. In detail, we provide a measurement workflow, a revised version of the approach, and describe a reproducible hardware testbed. Using this evaluation environment, we analyze the performance of the encryption scheme in a typical IoT scenario from a group member perspective. The results show that all calculation times can be assumed to be constant and are always below 2 seconds. The memory requirement for permanent parameters can also be considered to be constant and are below 8.5 kbit in each case. However, the information that has to be stored temporarily for group updates has turned out to be the bottleneck of the scheme, since their memory requirements increase linearly with the group size.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, Security, sss-group, from:sssgroup</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>IMPLEMENTATION OF MOSRE FRAMEWORK FOR A WEB APPLICATION - A CASE STUDY</b:Title><b:Year>2012</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>P.Salini</b:Last></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>S.Kanmani</b:Last></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>95-107</b:Pages><b:Volume>3</b:Volume><b:StandardNumber> ISSN: 0976 - 9811 (Online); 2230 - 7702 (print) DOI: 10.5121/ijwsc.2012.3309</b:StandardNumber><b:JournalName>International Journal on Web Service Computing (IJWSC)</b:JournalName><b:Issue>3</b:Issue><b:Month>September</b:Month><b:URL>http://airccse.org/journal/jwsc/papers/3312ijwsc09.pdf</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>The Security Engineering discipline has become more and more important in the recent years.

At the point of an investigation valuable information may be mishandled which leads to difficulties in the examination and time wastage. Additionally the intruder could obliterate tracks such as intrusion entry, vulnerabilities used in an entry, destruction caused, and most importantly the identity of the intruder. The aim of this research was to map the correlation between network security and network forensic mechanisms. There are three sub research questions that had been studied. Those have identified Network Security issues, Network Forensic investigations used in an incident, and the use of network forensics mechanisms to eliminate network security issues. Literature review has been the research strategy used in order study the sub research questions discussed. Literature such as research papers published in Journals, PhD Theses, ISO standards, and other official research papers have been evaluated and have been the base of this research. The deliverables or the output of this research was produced as a report on how network forensics has assisted in aligning network security in case of an intrusion. This research has not been specific to an organization but has given a general overview about the industry. Embedding Digital Forensics Framework, Network Forensic Development Life Cycle, and Enhanced Network Forensic Cycle could be used to develop a secure network. Through the mentioned framework, and cycles the author has recommended implementing the 4R Strategy (Resistance, Recognition, Recovery, Redress) with the assistance of a number of tools. This research would be of interest to Network Administrators, Network Managers, Network Security personnel, and other personnel interested in obtaining knowledge in securing communication devices/infrastructure. This research provides a framework that can be used in an organization to eliminate digital anomalies through network forensics, helps the above mentioned persons to prepare infrastructure readiness for threats and also enables further research to be carried on in the fields of computer, database, mobile, video, and audio</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Forensics, Guidelines, Issues, Network, Recommendation, Security, Set, and, attacks, forensic, mechanisms, of</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Data Storage Issues in Cloud Computing&#13;

Image is one of the perceptible sources in applications of Image Processing including a large number of tools and techniques which help to extract complex features of an image. Probably the most powerful image processing system is the human brain together with the eye. The system receives, enhances, and stores images at enormous rates of speed. The objective of Image Processing is to visually enhance or statistically evaluate some aspect of an image not readily apparent in its original form. Several technologies playing on images in real-time but image processing is the real core.

Cloud computing displaces database and application software to the large data centres, where the management of services and data may not be predictable, where as the conventional solutions, for IT services are under proper logical, physical and personal controls. This aspect attribute, however comprises different security challenges which have not been well understood. It concentrates on cloud data storage security which has always been an important aspect of quality of service (QOS). In this paper, we designed and simulated an adaptable and efficient scheme to guarantee the correctness of user data stored in the cloud and also with some prominent features. Homomorphic token is used for distributed verification of erasure ‚Äì coded data. By using this scheme, we can identify misbehaving servers. In spite of past works, our scheme supports effective and secure dynamic operations on data blocks such as data insertion, deletion and modification. In contrast to traditional solutions, where the IT services are under proper physical, logical and personnel controls, cloud computing moves the application software and databases to the large data centres, where the data management and services may not be absolutely truthful. This effective security and performance analysis describes that the proposed scheme is extremely flexible against malicious data modification, convoluted failures and server clouding attacks.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Cloud, Computing, Homomorphic, Security, Storage, token</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Data Security String Manipulation by Random Value in Hypertext Preprocessor&#13;

Capture The Flag are games where the hackers have to solve puzzles and find bugs so that they can get through system flaws and find flag, which is the main goal. Typical CTFs offer many challenges, most commonly the hackers have to exploit some kind of service so that you can get remote access to the server and read the content of the file that contains a special string called ‚Äúflag‚Äù, which is a proof that he she has hacked the system.

Since then, security has been a challenging problem in the Internet's world. That issue is called Cyberwar, in which attackers can aim or raise Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) to others to take down the operation of enterprises Intranet. Therefore, the need of applying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is very important to enterprise networks. In this paper, we propose a smarter solution to detect network anomalies in Cyberwar using Stacking techniques in which we apply three popular machine learning models: k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Random Decision Forests (RandomForest). Our proposed scheme uses the Logistic Regression method to automatically search for better parameters to the Stacking model. We do the performance evaluation of our proposed scheme on the latest data set NSLKDD 2019 dataset. We also compare the achieved results with individual machine learning models to show that our proposed model achieves much higher accuracy than previous works.&#13;

It is a method used for distributing a secret among the participants in a manner that only the threshold number of participants together can recover the secret and the remaining set of participants cannot get any information about the secret. Secret sharing schemes are absolute for storing highly sensitive and important information. In a secret sharing scheme, a secret is divided into several shares. These shares are then distributed to the participants‚Äô one each and thus only the threshold (t) number of participants can recover the secret. In this paper we have used Mignotte‚Äôs Sequence based Secret Sharing for distribution of shares to the participants. A (k, m) Mignotte's sequence is a sequence of pair wise co-prime positive integers. We have proposed a new method for reconstruction of secret even with t-1 shares using the SMT solver.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Data, Mignotte‚Äôs, SMT, Satisfiability, Secret, Security, sequence, sharing, solver</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfHeDmKo2021-ICPE-MQTT_TLS</b:Tag><b:Title>Performance Impact Analysis of Securing MQTT Using TLS</b:Title><b:Year>2021</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Herrnleben</b:Last><b:First>Stefan</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Engel</b:Last><b:First>Simon</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2021 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2021 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>April</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>ICPE'21</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>IoT, MQTT, Performance, Pub/Sub, Security, TLS, descartes, sss-group, t_short</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfDmKo2020-MASCOTS-GroupEncryption</b:Tag><b:Title>Evaluating the Performance of a State-of-the-Art Group-oriented Encryption Scheme for Dynamic Groups in an IoT Scenario</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Comments>Acceptance Rate: 27\%</b:Comments><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Ten</b:Last><b:First>Peter</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrenko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>November</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>MASCOTS '20</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>New emerging technologies, such as autonomous driving, intelligent buildings, and smart cities, are promising to revolutionize user experience and offer new services.

Before SCADA, plant personnel had to monitor and control industrial process via selector switches, pushbuttons and dials for analog signals. As manufacturing grew and sites became more remote, relays and timers were used to assist supervision. With the onset of technology and advent of network based protocols, these systems became more reliable, fast and it became easy to troubleshoot problems. Indeed progress also brings vulnerabilities, which was no new for SCADA. The IP protocols brought threat to the security of these systems. The devastation that cyber predators on SCADA can inflict, could be illustrated by the Stuxnet virus attack. This paper discusses what SCADA systems are, their uses, protocols being used by these systems, vulnerabilities and ways to combat those vulnerabilities. It focusses on the use of Blockchain Technology as a step in security of such systems.

The capabilities of these convenient mini-computers seem nearly boundless: They feature compelling computing power and storage resources, new interfaces such as Near Field Communication (NFC) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),connectivity to cloud services, as well as a vast number and variety of apps. By installing these apps, users can turn a mobile device into a music player, a gaming console,a navigation system, a business assistant, and more. In addition, the current trend of increased screen sizes make these devices reasonable replacements for traditional (mobile)computing platforms such as laptops.On the other hand, mobile platforms process and store the extensive amount of sensitive information about their users, ranging from the user ‚Äôs location data to credentials for online banking and enterprise Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This raises many security and privacy concerns and makes mobile platforms attractive targets for attackers. The rapid increase in number, variety and sophistication of attacks demonstrate that the protection mechanisms offered by mobile systems today are insufficient and improvements are necessary in order to make mobile devices capable of withstanding modern security and privacy threats.This dissertation focuses on various aspects of security and privacy of mobile platforms.In particular, it consists of three parts: (i) advanced attacks on mobile platforms and countermeasures; (ii) online authentication security for mobile systems, and (iii) secure mobile applications and services.Specifically, the first part of the dissertation concentrates on advanced attacks on mobile platforms, such as code re-use attacks that hijack execution flow of benign apps without injecting malicious code, and application-level privilege escalation attacks that allow malicious or compromised apps to gain more privileges than were initially granted. In this context, we develop new advanced code re-use attack techniques that can bypass deployed protection mechanisms (e.g., Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)) and cannot be detected by any of the existing security tools (e.g., return address checkers). Further, we investigate the problem of application-level privilege escalation attacks on mobile platforms like Android, study and classify them, develop proof of concept exploits and propose countermeasures against these attacks. Our countermeasures can mitigate all types of application-level privilege escalation attacks, in contrast to alternative solutions proposed in literature.In the second part of the dissertation we investigate online authentication schemes frequently utilized by mobile users, such as the most common web authentication based upon the user‚Äôs passwords and the recently widespread mobile2-factor authentication(2FA) which extends the password-based approach with a secondary authenticator sent toa user ‚Äôs mobile device or generated on it (e.g, a One-time Password (OTP) or Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)). In this context we demonstrate various weaknesses ofmobile2FAschemes deployed for login verification by global Internet service providers(such as Google, Dropbox, Twitter, and Facebook) and by a popular Google Authenticator app. These weaknesses allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users even if their mobile device with the secondary authenticator is not compromised. We then go one step further and develop a general attack method for bypassing mobile2FAschemes.Our method relies on a cross-platform infection (mobile-to-PC or PC-to-mobile) as a first step in order to compromise the Personal Computer (PC) and a mobile device of the same user. We develop proof-of-concept prototypes for a cross-platform infection and show how an attacker can bypass various instantiations of mobile2FAschemes once both devices,PC and the mobile platform, are infected. We then deliver proof-of-concept attack implementations that bypass online banking solutions based on SMS-based TAN sand visual cryptograms, as well as login verification schemes deployed by various Internet service providers. Finally, we propose a wallet-based secure solution for password-based authentication which requires no secondary authenticator, and yet provides better security guaranties than, e.g., mobile2FAschemes.The third part of the dissertation concerns design and development of security sensitive mobile applications and services. In particular, our first application allows mobile users to replace usual keys (for doors, cars, garages, etc.) with their mobile devices. It uses electronic access tokens which are generated by the central key server and then downloaded into mobile devices for user authentication. Our solution protects access tokens in transit (e.g., while they are downloaded on the mobile device) and when they are stored and processed on the mobile platform. The unique feature of our solution is offline delegation: Users can delegate (a portion of) their access rights to other users without accessing the key server. Further, our solution is efficient even when used with constraint communication interfaces like NFC.The second application we developed is devoted to resource sharing among mobile users in ad-hoc mobile networks. It enables users to, e.g., exchange files and text messages,or share their tethering connection. Our solution addresses security threats specific toresource sharing and features the required security mechanisms (e.g., access control of resources, pseudonymity for users, and accountability for resource use). One of the key features of our solution is a privacy-preserving access control of resources based on FoF Finder (FoFF) service, which provides a user-friendly means to configure access control based upon information from social networks (e.g., friendship information) while preserving user privacy (e.g., not revealing their social network identifiers).The results presented in this dissertation were included in several peer-reviewed publications [71,91,58,107,109,61,110,65,64,30] and extended technical reports [95,57,108,31]1. Some of these publications had significant impact on follow up research.For example, our publications on new forms of code re-use attacks [71,91] motivated researchers to develop more advanced forms of ASLR(e.g., [232,156,293,157]) and tore-consider the idea of using Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) (e.g., [51,300,303,182,233,77]). Further, our work on application-level privilege escalation attacks [94,57,59] was followed by many other publications addressing this problem (e.g., [106,122,209,155,146,69,63,302]). Moreover, our access control solution using mobile devices as access tokens[110,65] demonstrated significant practical impact: in2013it was chosen as a highlight of CeBIT ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest international computer expo, and was then deployed by a large enterprise to be used by tens of thousands of company employees and millions of customers.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, privacy, sss-group, from:sssgroup, security, Theses</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>article</b:Tag><b:Title>A real-time disease surveillance architecture using social networks</b:Title><b:Year>2012</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Sofean</b:Last><b:First>Mustafa</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>823-7</b:Pages><b:Volume>180</b:Volume><b:StandardNumber> DOI: 10.3233/978-1-61499-101-4-823</b:StandardNumber><b:JournalName>Studies in health technology and informatics</b:JournalName><b:Month>08</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, privacy, security, usablesecurity</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfDmKo2020-MASCOTS-GroupEncryption</b:Tag><b:Title>Evaluating the Performance of a State-of-the-Art Group-oriented Encryption Scheme for Dynamic Groups in an IoT Scenario</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Comments>Acceptance Rate: 27\%</b:Comments><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Ten</b:Last><b:First>Peter</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrenko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2020 IEEE 28th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>November</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>MASCOTS '20</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>New emerging technologies, such as autonomous driving, intelligent buildings, and smart cities, are promising to revolutionize user experience and offer new services.

The results show that all calculation times can be assumed to be constant and are always below 2 seconds. The memory requirement for permanent parameters can also be considered to be constant and are below 8.5 kbit in each case. However, the information that has to be stored temporarily for group updates has turned out to be the bottleneck of the scheme, since their memory requirements increase linearly with the group size.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Group_Encryption, Internet_of_Things, t_full, Security, myown, Performance_Evaluation, descartes, sss-group</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>nayana2020phoenix</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>PHOENIX -THE BLIND LEARNING APPLICATION</b:Title><b:Year>2020</b:Year><b:Comments>1.

As per our society is concerned, there are many learning solutions for the especially abled citizens, and in case of blinds there are little efforts introduced. Those small efforts taken to provide learning platforms or solutions for visually impaired people require the help of another person. Since blinds are the users of this application, the app concentrates on voice recognition, speech to text conversion and finger touch sense concepts which makes the application easier for the users. As the application runs on the background and it can be opened using speech, it makes the users to be independent. This application enhances the learning via providing audio tutorials on different subjects which can be learned theoretically. The users can communicate with the application through speech. With rapid growth of wireless communication, the need for voice recognition techniques has increased greatly. In the application, controls are provided via voice and touch mechanism.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>application, blind, learning, phoenix, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>TUD-CS-2015-0005</b:Tag><b:Title>Market-driven Code Provisioning to Mobile Secure Hardware</b:Title><b:Year>2015</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrienko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Heuser</b:Last><b:First>Stephan</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Nguyen</b:Last><b:Middle>Duc</b:Middle><b:First>Thien</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>da Silva Ramos</b:Last><b:First>Marcos</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Rein</b:Last><b:First>Andre</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Sadeghi</b:Last><b:First>Ahmad-Reza</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference (FC)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference (FC)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>January</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Architecture, Cards, Hardware, International-Conference-Workshop-Papers-Book-Chapters, Java, Mobile, Platforms, Secure, Security, sss-group</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>PrTeIfHeDmKo2021-ICPE-GroupEncryptionCentralizedBenchmark</b:Tag><b:Title>Towards a Group Encryption Scheme Benchmark: A View on Centralized Schemes with focus on IoT</b:Title><b:Year>2021</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Prantl</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Ten</b:Last><b:First>Peter</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Iffl√§nder</b:Last><b:First>Lukas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Herrnleben</b:Last><b:First>Stefan</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Dmitrenko</b:Last><b:First>Alexandra</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Kounev</b:Last><b:First>Samuel</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Krupitzer</b:Last><b:First>Christian</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:BookTitle>2021 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE)</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>2021 ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE)</b:ConferenceName><b:Month>April</b:Month><b:BIBTEX_Series>ICPE'21</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Benchmark, Energy\_Efficiency, Group\_Encyrption\_Scheme, Security, descartes, sss-group, t_short, myown</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:Title>So Long, And No Thanks for the Externalities: The Rational Rejection of Security Advice by Users</b:Title><b:Year>2016</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Herley</b:Last><b:First>Cormac</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:URL>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SoLongAndNoThanks.pdf</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Authentication System Based on the Combination of Voice Biometrics and OTP Generation&#13;

Voice authentication is the verification of identity based on the analysis of an individual's voice. Voice authentication has various advantages, but it is seldom implemented due its shortcomings as compared to other forms of biometric authentication. In this paper we have discussed about the approach for the implementation of voice authentication system through the combination of OTP to increase its real world applicability and reduce its shortcomings.

Several contract tracing apps have been proposed or deployed in practice. Also Google and Apple have announced their joint effort of providing an API for exposure notification in order to implement decentralized contract tracing apps using Bluetooth Low Energy, the so-called "Google/Apple Proposal", which we abbreviate by "GAP". Some countries have already decided or are planning to base their contact tracing apps on GAP. Several researchers have pointed out potential privacy and security risks related to most of the contact tracing approaches proposed until now, including those that claim privacy protection and are based on GAP. This report makes a first attempt towards providing empirical evidence in real-world scenarios for two such risks discussed in the literature: one concerning privacy, and the other one concerning security. In particular, we focus on a practical analysis of GAP, given that it is the foundation of several tracing apps. We demonstrate that in real-world scenarios the current GAP design is vulnerable to (i) profiling and possibly de-anonymizing infected persons, and (ii) relay-based wormhole attacks that principally can generate fake contacts with the potential of significantly affecting the accuracy of an app-based contact tracing system. For both types of attack, we have built tools that can be easily used on mobile phones or Raspberry Pis (e.g., Bluetooth sniffers). We hope that our findings provide valuable input in the process of testing and certifying contact tracing apps, e.g., as planned for the German Corona-Warn-App, ultimately guiding improvements for secure and privacy-preserving design and implementation of digital contact tracing systems. </b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>apple, bluetooth, contact_tracing, coronavirus, covid-19, google, myown, privacy, security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>ConferenceProceedings</b:SourceType><b:BIBTEX_Entry>inproceedings</b:BIBTEX_Entry><b:Tag>10.1145/2335356.2335371</b:Tag><b:Title>Helping Johnny 2.0 to Encrypt His Facebook Conversations</b:Title><b:Year>2012</b:Year><b:Author><b:Author><b:NameList><b:Person><b:Last>Fahl</b:Last><b:First>Sascha</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Harbach</b:Last><b:First>Marian</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Muders</b:Last><b:First>Thomas</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Smith</b:Last><b:First>Matthew</b:First></b:Person><b:Person><b:Last>Sander</b:Last><b:First>Uwe</b:First></b:Person></b:NameList></b:Author></b:Author><b:Pages>11</b:Pages><b:StandardNumber> ISBN: 9781450315326 DOI: 10.1145/2335356.2335371</b:StandardNumber><b:Publisher>Association for Computing Machinery</b:Publisher><b:City>New York, NY, USA</b:City><b:BookTitle>Proceedings of the Eighth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security</b:BookTitle><b:ConferenceName>Proceedings of the Eighth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security</b:ConferenceName><b:URL>https://doi.org/10.1145/2335356.2335371</b:URL><b:BIBTEX_Series>SOUPS ‚Äô12</b:BIBTEX_Series><b:BIBTEX_Abstract>Several billion Facebook messages are sent every day. While there are many solutions to email security whose usability has been extensively studied, little work has been done in the area of message security for Facebook and even less on the usability aspects in this area. To evaluate the need for such a mechanism, we conducted a screening study with 514 participants, which showed a clear desire to protect private messages on Facebook. We therefore proceeded to analyse the usability of existing approaches and extracted key design decisions for further evaluation. Based on this analysis, we conducted a laboratory study with 96 participants to analyse different usability aspects and requirements of a Facebook message encryption mechanism. Two key findings of our study are that automatic key management and key recovery capabilities are important features for such a mechanism. Following on from these studies, we designed and implemented a usable service-based encryption mechanism for Facebook conversations. In a final study with 15 participants, we analysed the usability of our solution. All participants were capable of successfully encrypting their Facebook conversations without error when using our service, and the mechanism was perceived as usable and useful. The results of our work suggest that in the context of the social web, new security/usability trade-offs can be explored to protect users more effectively.</b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>myown, security, usablesecurity</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>A Study on Cyber Forensic Science to Diagnose Digital Crimes&#13;

The world has to undergo large scale deployment of billions of things ‚Äî cost-efficient intelligent sensors that will be interconnected into extensive networks and will collect and supply data to intelligent algorithms ‚Äî to make it happen. To date, however, it is challenging to secure such an infrastructure for many-fold reasons, such as resource constraints of things, large scale deployment, manyto-many communication patterns, and dynamically changing communication groups. All these factors rule out most of the state-of-the-art encryption and key-management techniques. Group encryption algorithms are well-suitable for many-tomany communication patterns typical for IoT networks, and many of them can deal with dynamic groups. There are, however, very few constructions that could potentially fulfill the computational and storage constraints of IoT devices while providing sufficient scalability for large networks. The promising candidates, such as construction by Nishat et al. [1], were not evaluated using IoT platforms and under constraints typical for IoT networks. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and present the evaluation of a state-of-the-art group-oriented encryption scheme by Nishat et al. to identify its applicability to IoT systems. In detail, we provide a measurement workflow, a revised version of the approach, and describe a reproducible hardware testbed. Using this evaluation environment, we analyze the performance of the encryption scheme in a typical IoT scenario from a group member perspective. The results show that all calculation times can be assumed to be constant and are always below 2 seconds.

This study evaluates the effects of varying nitrogen and zinc rates on growth and yield of maize in Abaji, Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. Four Nitrogen levels (0 kg N/ha, 40 kg N/ha, 80 kg N/ha and 120 kg N/ha) were evaluate with two Zinc levels (0 kg Zn/ha and 2 kg Zn/ha). The experimental factors were combined with a Factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Nitrogen was applied as Urea while Zn was applied with Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO4). Phosphorous was applied with Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the rate of 60 kg P2O5/ha and potassium was supplied with Muriate of Potash (MOP) at 60 kg K2O/ha. Result shows that Nitrogen application rate of 80 kg N/ha gave the optimum yield in the study area and was recommended for adoption along with other sustainable soil nutrient management practices. </b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>Food, Security</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>Issues of Psychological Security Formation in Youth Against Information Threats&#13;

General strain theory and social bond theory were, adopted as the theoretical frame of the study. While the former explains how blocked opportunities among the lower class youths lead to delinquency, and consequently, to insecurity in the society, the latter explains how weakened bond to conventional social institutions reduces social control of young persons, and subsequently, leading to insecurity in the society. Thus, abuse of children will have a long term effect and elicit deprivation that can later be, expressed through delinquency or crime. The article principally relied on secondary data. The article concludes that child abuse has many social and psychological consequences and they are associated to security challenges in Nigeria. As differently indicated by the data cited in this article, most of the city hooligans, members of urban gangs, Boko Haram and other forms of criminal gangs are largely from lower classes and majority have in one way or the other experienced child abuse and neglect. To overcome the menace of child abuse in Nigeria and by implication the insecurity, the article recommended that the Government, NGOs, community members and families should provide means for child protection, poverty reduction, and creation of awareness, etc. Ahmad S.

Insurances are the co‚Äì operative device who distribute the loss caused by a particular risk.When any insurances company face any types of mismanagement, they should look for a market for that policy instead of constantly lying to the public or with their clients. Market competition brings decrease in price of the insurances company and increase in the quality but customer play their part according to their views. In the unpredictable society insurances paly a secure part but customers face many other problems. In this paper we will discussed about the problems faced by the customers and also their reasons why many people don‚Äôt have faith in the insurances company.

Each area has security&#13;
vulnerabilities and, hopefully, some corresponding countermeasures that raise the security level and provide better protection. The fundamental concepts in information security are the security model, which outlines how security is to be implemented. A security policy outlines how data is accessed, what level of security is required, and what actions should be taken when these requirements are not met. A security model is a statement that outlines the requirements necessary to properly support and implement a certain security policy. An important concept in the design and analysis of secure systems is the security model, because it incorporates the security policy that should be enforced in the system. A model is a symbolic representation of a policy. It maps the desires of the policy makers into a set of rules that are to be followed by a computer system. In the paper we propose a model driven security assessment and verification for business service. The Security Assessment and Verification verifies whether the Application and Services are secure based on the Service Level Agreement and generates the report on the level of security features. It is designed to help business owners, operators and staff to assess the security of their business. It covers potential areas of vulnerability, and provides suggestions for adapting your security to reduce the risk of crime against your business. A security policy states that no one from a lower security level should be able to view or modify information at a higher security level, the supporting security model will outline the necessary logic and rules that need to be implemented to ensure that under no circumstances can a lower-level subject access a higher-level object in an unauthorized manner. The security policy is an abstract term that represents the objectives and goals a system must meet and accomplish to be deemed secure and acceptable. </b:BIBTEX_Abstract><b:BIBTEX_KeyWords>(SLA), Agreement, Level, Policies, Security, Service, and, assessment, verification</b:BIBTEX_KeyWords></b:Source><b:Source><b:SourceType>JournalArticle</b:SourceType><b:Tag>noauthororeditor</b:Tag><b:LCID>0</b:LCID><b:Title>THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN &#13;
